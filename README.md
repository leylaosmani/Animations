# Sample Snack app

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

Here we have a snack application where you are able to conduct multiple animations on a circle.

1. Change the colour from red to yellow.
2. Perform a spring animation on the shape.
3. Fade the circle.
